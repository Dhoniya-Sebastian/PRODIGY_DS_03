**Problem Statement :** 
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioural data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This task involved building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioural data. I used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for this task.

Key Features Implemented in the Task:

● Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was ready for model training.

● Model Building: Built a decision tree classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.

● Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its predictive accuracy.

About the Task: This task allowed me to delve deep into the world of machine learning and data analysis. From data preprocessing to model evaluation, each step was a learning experience that highlighted the importance of data in decision-making processes.
